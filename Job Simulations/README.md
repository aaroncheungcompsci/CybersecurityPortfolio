# Job Simulations
In this directory, I showcase what I have done in job simulations found on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com). This is to provide myself with "on the job" experience to showcase to potential employers.

## Purpose
In my journey through finding a relevant job, I've realized that I have almost no real world experience. Sure, I did have a couple of jobs in the past as a student assistant for an IT department, or as a Quality Engineer... but nothing directly related to what I wanted to do originally, which is being immersed in software development, but now transitioned to IT or cybersecurity work.
