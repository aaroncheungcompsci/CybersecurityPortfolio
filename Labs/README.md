# Cybersecurity Labs

This folder contains documentation of my practical/hands-on experience in cybersecurity. It is currently a work in progress as I work through the various labs that I find online or the labs I have experienced during my undergrad years.

If you would like to see a more indepth description of each lab, you can navigate into any folder of your choosing to see them.  My (updated) runthrough of the labs will most likely be a README.md file to easily read the contents of my findings. 

## Labs in Progress
- Network Security
    - Firewall Exploration
    - Heartbleed
- Web Security
    - XSS (Cross Site Scripting)

## Resources
