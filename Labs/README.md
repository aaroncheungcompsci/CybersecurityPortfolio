# Cybersecurity Labs

This folder contains documentation of my practical/hands-on experience in cybersecurity. For now, it only contains information about the labs I did when I was still an undergraduate, but I will be recreating these labs to refresh my skillset. Eventually, I will be adding information regarding the research I do on other platforms like HTB (HackTheBox) and TryHackMe very soon.
