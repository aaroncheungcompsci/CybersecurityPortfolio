# Cybersecurity Labs

This folder contains documentation of my practical/hands-on experience in cybersecurity. For now, it only contains information about the labs I did when I was still an undergraduate, but I will be recreating these labs to refresh my skillset. Eventually, I will be adding information regarding the research I do on other platforms like HTB (HackTheBox) and TryHackMe very soon.

If you would like to see a more indepth description of each lab, you can navigate into any folder of your choosing to see them.  My updated runthrough of the labs will most likely be a README.md file to easily read the contents of my findings when I do the labs again.
